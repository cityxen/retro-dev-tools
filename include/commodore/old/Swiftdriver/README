The purpose of this software is to allow the CMD SwiftLink and compatibles (such as the CMD Turbo232, and various clones) to be used from BASIC or Machine Language on a Commodore 64 via the standard Kernal calls.  In other words, so long as a particular piece of software does not collide in memory with this code (< 512 bytes), and does all of its serial access through the standard kernal calls, it will work with SwiftLink RS232 just like it worked with C= user port RS2332.

As of this writing, error checking is not implemented, and DCD, CTS, and DSR have not been implemented, but it's coming.  Since the kernal requires that you actually poll the CIA chip port address, it obviously won't be identical, which is why I didn't think anyone would expect it out of this, but I'll come up with a duplicate at least.

-------------------

To use this software, it needs to be loaded into memory, and then setup by using:
SYS 49152

After this, all the normal OPEN, CLOSE, GET, PRINT, etc commands will work as normal.

Here is some example code:

10 IF A=0 THEN A=1:LOAD "SWIFTDRVR49152",8,1
20 SYS 49152 : REM Turn On The SwiftDriver
30 OPEN 5,2,0,CHR$(14) : REM Open RS232 at 9600 BAUD
40 GET#5,A$:IF A$ <> "" THEN PRINT A$;
50 GET A$:IF A$ <> "" THEN PRINT#5,A$;
60 GOTO 40

Here are all the baud rates:
