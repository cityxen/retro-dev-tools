To install LEPIX you first need to compile the sources.
LEPIX is written using MADS assembler by Tomasz 'TeBe' Biela, available
on the LEPIX homepage.

To compile issue the following command:
  mads.exe lepix.asx -o:lepix.xex -l -t

This will create LEPIX.XEX file.

Note, that since LEPIX supports multiple graphics modes it is necessary to
tell it which mode to use for the current compilation.
The used module is defined in lepix.asx file, in this part:

		ift !GFX_MODE
GFX_MODE	equ 1	; MIC
;GFX_MODE	equ 2	; INP
;GFX_MODE	equ 3	; CIN
;GFX_MODE	equ 4	; HIP
;GFX_MODE	equ 5	; TIP
		eif

This code means that MIC version will be compiled.
If you need to e.g. compile INP version, just modify that code into:

		ift !GFX_MODE
;GFX_MODE	equ 1	; MIC
GFX_MODE	equ 2	; INP
;GFX_MODE	equ 3	; CIN
;GFX_MODE	equ 4	; HIP
;GFX_MODE	equ 5	; TIP
		eif

You can also specify which mode you want to compile with a command line
switch for mads. For example to compile CIN mode, do:
  mads lepix.asx -o:lepixhip.xex -l -t  -d:GFX_MODE=3
