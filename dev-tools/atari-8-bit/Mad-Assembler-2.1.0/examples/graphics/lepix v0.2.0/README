Some hints:

- I/O operations add a file extension 
  and a drive name if not specified 
  ('D:'). Example translations 
  (when loading MIC):
    FIGHT        -> D:FIGHT.MIC
    FIGHT.PIC    -> D:FIGHT.PIC
    D:FIGHT      -> D:FIGHT.MIC
    D1:FIGHT     -> D1:FIGHT.MIC
    D1:FIGHT.MIC -> D1:FIGHT.MIC
- On program load the image memory is 
  not cleaned.
  You can do it by pressing TAB,C,Y
- INP: to create INP from two MIC 
  pictures load the first of them as 
  MIC(1) and the second as MIC(2)
- CIN: to create a CIN picture, 
  load a MIC picture, clear colors 
  only and color the picture using 
  the 'tone' mode

=====================================
ToDo:

- copy-paste of rectangular blocks
- save/restore snapshots using 
  extended memory
- code review.
- improve mouse
- add lightpen support
- add hires modes: GR8, IN8, HR2
- INP: various interlace modes: 
  checkers, lines(, frames?)
- View mode: pressing 'V' should 
  result in all menus disappearing
- pictures larger than 200 scanlines 
  - up to 238 lines
  (or 119 in double-scanline modes), 
  with main-part scrolled up/down.
- common file format: introduce a new 
  file format that would support 
  various graphic modes
