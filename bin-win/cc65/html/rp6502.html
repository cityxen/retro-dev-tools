<P>The Picocomputer 6502 is a modern W65C02S computer with a custom operating
system designed to be POSIX-like. The reference design includes a W65C02S,
W65C22S, RP6502-RIA, and optionally a RP6502-VGA. Peripheral devices like
keyboards, mice, and flash storage are connected by USB to the RP6502-RIA.
Audio is generated by the RP6502-RIA. Video is generated by the RP6502-VGA.</P>



<H2><A NAME="s2">2.</A> <A HREF="#toc2">Binary format</A></H2>


<P>The standard binary output format generated by the linker for the RP6502 target
is a plain machine language program without any prefix or postfix.</P>
<P>The RP6502 Integrated Development Environment, based on Visual Studio Code,
will convert the cc65 binary output into RP6502 ROM files that can be loaded
directly from the RP6502 monitor or installed on the RIA to be loaded at boot.</P>

<DT><B>Stack</B><DD>
<P>The C run-time stack is located at $FEFF, and grows downward.</P>

<DT><B>Heap</B><DD>
<P>The C heap is located at the end of the program, and grows toward the C
run-time stack.</P>

<DT><B>RAM</B><DD>
<P>RAM is located at $0000 - $FEFF. Default binaries load and
start at $0200.</P>

<DT><B>ROM</B><DD>
<P>The RP6502 is designed with no ROM in the 6502 address space.</P>
